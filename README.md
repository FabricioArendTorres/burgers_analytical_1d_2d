# burgers_analytical_1d_2d
Analytical burgers equation in 1d and 2d over time. 
Also contains analytical solution fundamental heat equation and fokkerplanck equation in 3d.

See `main.py` for an example on how to evaluate the solution on a spatiotemporal grid. 

Burgers implementation is based on:
Gao, Q., and M. Y. Zou. "An analytical solution for two and three dimensional nonlinear Burgers' equation." Applied Mathematical Modelling 45 (2017): 255-270.
